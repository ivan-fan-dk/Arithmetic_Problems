## Intention
I have just got a job as a tutor right now, and I saw my mentees struggling with arithmetics. Therefore an idea popped up. What if a computer can help with generating arithmetic problems so that people can train with it? That's why the project comes up.

## How to play with it?
### Online
1. Click link her [https://arithmetic.neocities.org/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/) (A great thanks to **neocities**)
2. **(Chinese simplified version/简体中文版本)**[https://arithmetic.neocities.org/zh/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/zh/).
3. **(Danish version/Dansk version)**[https://arithmetic.neocities.org/dk/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/dk/).

## Some improvements can be done in the future.
- ... Well, there were some before, but not right now. &#128541;

## Easter Eggs
1. A hidden difficulty level is **Asian** (inspired by a Youtuber *Steven He* who ranks **Asian** as the most difficult level). You might unlock this feature if you dive into the developers tools of the browser, unfold the code, and delete `hidden` in `<option value="Asian" hidden>Asian</option>`.
2. **(for version 1.1.1 and forward)** If "spare me" is typed in the textbox, then it still counts as correct. Just for fun!

## Last words
- Feel free to download and modify the source code. I will be more than glad if you can share it with others who is in need, or maybe just for fun.
- Feel free to give advice on GitHub.
