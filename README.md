# Arithmetic_Problems

## Description
An interactive web application designed to help users practice arithmetic problems. The application has evolved through various version updates, incorporating new features and improvements.

## Update Log
Update log can be found [here](update.md).

## Intention
I have just got a job as a tutor, and I saw my mentees struggling with arithmetics. Therefore an idea popped up. What if a computer can help with generating arithmetic problems so that people can train with it? That's why the project comes up.

## How to Engage
### Online
1. Click link here [https://arithmetic.neocities.org/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/) (A great thanks to **neocities**)
2. **(Chinese simplified version/简体中文版本)** [https://arithmetic.neocities.org/zh/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/zh/).
3. **(Danish version/Dansk version)** [https://arithmetic.neocities.org/dk/](https://arithmetic.neocities.org/dk/).

## Future Improvements
The project may have future enhancements, although specifics are currently unspecified.

## Easter Eggs
1. A hidden difficulty level is **Asian** (inspired by a Youtuber *Steven He* who ranks **Asian** as the most difficult level). You might unlock this feature if you dive into the developers tools of the browser, unfold the code, and delete `hidden` in `<option value="Asian" hidden>Asian</option>`.
2. **(for version 1.1.1 and onward)** If "spare me" is typed in the textbox, then it still counts as correct. Just for fun!

## Difficulty Levels
Detailed difficulty level descriptions can be found [here](difficulty.md).

## Final Notes
